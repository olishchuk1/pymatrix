# Pymatrix

## General description:
Learning library for working with matrices and systems of linear equations (SOLE) implemented on Python programing language.

## List of Contents
**Using Pymatrix labrary you can:**
- find the determinant of a matrix (NxN);
- find the inverted matrix of a matrix (NxN);
- find the determinant of a matrix (NxN) using a Gaussian method;
- find the inverted matrix of a matrix (NxN) using a Gaussian method with a gradual selection of the principal element;
- find the SOLE solution using a Gaussian method;
- find the SOLE solution by the LU-decomposition (L with ones on the main diagonal);
- find the SOLE solution by the LU-decomposition (U with ones on the main diagonal);
- arrangement of symmetric matrices ((U^T)U-decomposition)
